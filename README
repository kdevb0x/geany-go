geany-go: A geany plugin to help make it a more enjoyable experience writing Go.

[Go Programming Language (https://golang.org)]

Built in the spirit of vim-go.

Roadmap:

    gocode: Integrate gocode for autocompletion. (See how deoplete-go is doing it)

    gobuild: add gobuild to geany build menu.

    gotest: Integrate gotest somehow; this may require adding terminal to geany
    	    (which is something I would like to do anyways)

    gotools: Possibly integrate some of the go tools (maybe under a menu?)

    If you have any questions, or need to reach me for any legitimate reasons,
    you can do so by email at kdevb0x@gmail.com

    If it is directly related to this code, including bug reports, and feature
    requests, please open an issue. My aim is for the issues section to speak
    as a sort of timeline/histogram of the evolution of the project.

Thanks!
